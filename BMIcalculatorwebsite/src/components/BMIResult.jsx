Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutririous diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Aditionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.</p>
